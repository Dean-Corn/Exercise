#Final Exam
I created a search component to handle the user side of the typeahead.
The server side of the typeahead contains the function to filter out an array of Names.
This function is stored in server/exercise/model.js as FilterUsers.
The get function made from this is located in server/exercise/controller.js and has the url extension /allusers/:Text

I was unable to get the typeahead to work on the html side, however through testing on postman I was able to confirm my server side functions are working.







# Exercise
This is the repository for the exercise application being created in my Spring 2018 Web Server Programming Course.

The requirements for this application are for it to have profile management, an exercise log, and the ability to share with friends.
This project is to be worked on for the full length of the course.
